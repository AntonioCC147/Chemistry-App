This skeleton consists of 2 applications that need to be installed using npm:

- To install backend, run command `cd .\backend\` from project root directory and then install with command `npm i`
- Similarly, install frontend from `frontend` folder

## Running

The 2 applications need to be run separately:

- To start backend, go to `backend` folder and run command `npm start`
    - Backend might also need `nodemon` to start, run command `npm i -g nodemon` from `backend` folder to install nodemon
- Similarly start frontend from `frontend` folder
