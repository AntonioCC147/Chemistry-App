## Features

- Simple frontend built using React
    - If you don't want to use React, just delete the contents of `frontend` and use plain HTML
- Simple backend app using NodeJS

## Installation

To use this skeleton you will need the following tools:

- node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- MongoDB Community Server: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
- MongoDB Compass: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass

> **Note**: MongoDB Community Server installer will prompt you to install MongoDB Compass, you can check the box and skip last step :)

Other recommended tools for developing applications:

- Postman: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

This skeleton consists of 2 applications that need to be installed using npm:

- To install backend, run command `cd .\backend\` from project root directory and then install with command `npm i`
- Similarly, install frontend from `frontend` folder

## Running

The 2 applications need to be run separately:

- To start backend, go to `backend` folder and run command `npm start`
    - Backend might also need `nodemon` to start, run command `npm i -g nodemon` from `backend` folder to install nodemon
- Similarly start frontend from `frontend` folder

## Important!!!

Do **NOT** fork this repository, the fork will be public!

Instead, download code as .zip archive and copy into your personal project directory if you want to use it.
